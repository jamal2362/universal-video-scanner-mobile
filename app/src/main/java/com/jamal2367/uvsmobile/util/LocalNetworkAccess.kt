/**
 * Whether this app may talk to an address on the network it is on.
 *
 * Android 17 made that a permission of its own: a server in the same flat is no
 * longer simply "the internet", and an app that was never granted it has its
 * connections dropped rather than refused. That arrives as a connect timeout
 * six seconds later and looks exactly like a server that is switched off -
 * which is the whole reason this is worth naming in the interface instead of
 * leaving it to be diagnosed from a log.
 *
 * Every address this app knows is a local one, so the permission is asked for
 * at startup rather than at the first request.
