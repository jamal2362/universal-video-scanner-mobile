/**
 * The note about the last address that answered, on disk.
 *
 * Deliberately not in the DataStore the rest of the settings live in. This is
 * read from an OkHttp thread while the very first request is being addressed,
 * before any flow has emitted anything; shared preferences answer that
 * synchronously, which is the whole requirement. It is one string and a
 * timestamp, so the file is read in a moment.
 *
 * The note goes stale on purpose. Outside the flat the remote address is the
 * one that works and a relaunch should go straight to it - but back home the
 * local address is the shorter way to the same instance, and nothing tells the
 * app which network it is on. A few hours covers an evening out and still has
 * the next morning start at home.
