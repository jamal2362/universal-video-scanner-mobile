 * A note of which address last answered, kept across launches.
 *
 * Without it every cold start outside the flat begins by asking the local
 * address, which is not on this network and cannot say so: the request sits
 * there until the connect timeout runs out, and nothing is on screen until it
 * does. The note turns that into the one address that is going to answer.
 *
 * Read from an OkHttp thread on the way out of the first request, which is why
 * it is synchronous - a value that arrives after the request it was meant to
 * steer is no value at all.
