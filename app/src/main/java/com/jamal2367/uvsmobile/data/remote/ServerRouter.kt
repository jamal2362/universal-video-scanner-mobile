/**
 * Which of the two configured instances a request goes to.
 *
 * The interesting case is a phone that leaves the flat: the local address stops
 * resolving and every call would fail, so in [ConnectionMode.AUTO] the router
 * hands out both and lets the caller walk down the list. The one that last
 * answered is tried first, so the fallback costs one failed connection rather
 * than one per request.
 *
 * That is remembered past the end of the session too, through [memory]: a cold
 * start outside the flat would otherwise open by asking the local address, and
 * an address that is not on this network answers nothing at all - the request
 * sits there for the whole connect timeout, with an empty screen behind it,
 * before the one that works is even tried.
